Thank you for helping improve the documentation - much appreciated!

## Checklist

The documentation consists of:

- The newest release (located in the `/versioned_docs/version-*/` directory)
- The nightly (located in the `/docs/` directory)

These two versions require separate handling for changes:

- **New**: changes to the nightly documentation that is not published
- **Amend**: changes to the stable documentation that is published

Please make sure to check and complete:

- [ ] I have chosen the right change type (at least one of the following meets)
  - **New**: my change only applies to the nightly documentation
  - **Amend**: my change targets the newest released documentation, and these changes have also been synced to the nightly documentation
- [ ] I used the right contents (at least one of the following meets)
  - **New**: my change applies to the nightly version of Yazi
  - **Amend**: my change applies to the newest stable version of Yazi
