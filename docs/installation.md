# Installation

To use Yazi, you must have the following prerequisites installed:

- [`file`](https://github.com/file/file) (for file type detection)

Yazi can be **optionally** extended with other command line tools to enable additional features.

- [nerd-fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) ([_recommended_](/docs/faq#dont-like-nerd-fonts))
- [`ffmpeg`](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) (for video thumbnails)
- [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) (for archive extraction and preview)
- [`jq`](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) (for JSON preview)
- [`poppler`](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/) (for PDF preview)
- [`fd`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) (for file searching)
- [`rg`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) (for file content searching)
- [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) (for quick file subtree navigation, >= 0.53.0)
- [`zoxide`](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) (for historical directories navigation, requires `fzf`)
- [`resvg`](https://github.com/linebender/resvg) (for SVG preview)
- [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) (for Font, HEIC, and JPEG XL preview, >= 7.1.1)
- [`xclip`](https://github.com/astrand/xclip) / [`wl-clipboard`](https://github.com/bugaevc/wl-clipboard) / [`xsel`](https://github.com/kfish/xsel) (for Linux clipboard support)

If the functions are not working properly, please try upgrading them to the latest version.

## Packaging status {#packaging}

Most packages on this page are maintained by the community, and they **_may not always be the latest_**. Please check their versions before installation:

<a alt="Yazi packaging status" href="https://repology.org/project/yazi/versions">
	<img alt="Yazi packaging status" height="785" src="https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/yazi.svg" />
</a>

## Arch Linux {#arch}

```sh
sudo pacman -S yazi ffmpeg 7zip jq poppler fd ripgrep fzf zoxide resvg imagemagick
```

If you want to use the latest Git version, you can install it from [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yazi-git/) or [Arch Linux CN](https://github.com/archlinuxcn/repo/):

```sh
paru -S yazi-git ffmpeg 7zip jq poppler fd ripgrep fzf zoxide resvg imagemagick
```

You can also install the [official nightly release binary](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/releases/tag/nightly) from [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yazi-nightly-bin),
which is built from the latest code within the past 6 hours:

```sh
paru -S yazi-nightly-bin ffmpeg 7zip jq poppler fd ripgrep fzf zoxide resvg imagemagick
```

## Nix {#nix}

A [Nix package](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&show=yazi) for Yazi is available.

```sh
# NixOS:
nix-env -iA nixos.yazi

# Not NixOS:
nix-env -iA nixpkgs.yazi
```

Or add the following to your configuration:

```nix
# configuration.nix
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
	(yazi.override {
		_7zz = _7zz-rar;  # Support for RAR extraction
	})
];
```

You can also manage Yazi's configuration using [home-manager](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/options.xhtml#opt-programs.yazi.enable), here is a configuration template example:

<details>
  <summary>Demonstrate configuring Yazi with home-manager</summary>

```nix
{pkgs, ...}: let
	yazi-plugins = pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {
		owner = "yazi-rs";
		repo = "plugins";
		rev = "...";
		hash = "sha256-...";
	};
in {
	programs.yazi = {
		enable = true;
		enableZshIntegration = true;
		shellWrapperName = "y";

		settings = {
			mgr = {
				show_hidden = true;
			};
			preview = {
				max_width = 1000;
				max_height = 1000;
			};
		};

		plugins = {
			chmod = "${yazi-plugins}/chmod.yazi";
			full-border = "${yazi-plugins}/full-border.yazi";
			toggle-pane = "${yazi-plugins}/toggle-pane.yazi";
			starship = pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {
				owner = "Rolv-Apneseth";
				repo = "starship.yazi";
				rev = "...";
				sha256 = "sha256-...";
			};
		};

		initLua = ''
			require("full-border"):setup()
			require("starship"):setup()
		'';

		keymap = {
			mgr.prepend_keymap = [
				{
					on = "T";
					run = "plugin toggle-pane max-preview";
					desc = "Maximize or restore the preview pane";
				}
				{
					on = ["c" "m"];
					run = "plugin chmod";
					desc = "Chmod on selected files";
				}
			];
		};
	};
}
```

</details>

## Nix flakes {#flakes}

The upstream repository provides a flake so that Nix users can easily keep up with the bleeding edge. A basic `flake.nix` setup to get you started:

```nix
{
	inputs = {
		nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-23.11";

		home-manager = {
			url = "github:nix-community/home-manager/release-23.11";
			inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
		};

		yazi.url = "github:sxyazi/yazi";
	};

	outputs = { nixpkgs, home-manager, yazi, ... }: {
		# To install Yazi system-wide:
		nixosConfigurations = {
			nixos = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
				modules = [
					({ pkgs, ... }: {
						environment.systemPackages = [
							(yazi.packages.${pkgs.system}.default.override {
								_7zz = pkgs._7zz-rar;  # Support for RAR extraction
							})
						];
					})
				];
			};
		};

		# To install it for a specific user:
		homeConfigurations = {
			"alice@nixos" = home-manager.lib.homeManagerConfiguration {
				pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.x86_64-linux;
				modules = [
					({ pkgs, ... }: {
						home.packages = [
							(yazi.packages.${pkgs.system}.default.override {
								_7zz = pkgs._7zz-rar;  # Support for RAR extraction
							})
						];
					})
				];
			};
		};
	};
}
```

If you want to override the package inside nixpkgs with the one from the flake, you can use overlays:

```nix
nixpkgs.overlays = [ yazi.overlays.default ];
```

A module is also available for both NixOS and home-manager:

```nix
programs.yazi = {
	enable = true;
	# You can omit this if you use overlays
	package = yazi.packages.${pkgs.system}.default.override {
		_7zz = pkgs._7zz-rar;  # Support for RAR extraction
	};
};
```

### Cache

Pre-built artifacts are served at https://yazi.cachix.org, so that Nix users don't have to build Yazi on their machine.
You can make use of it by adding the following options to `nix.settings`, either in your NixOS or home-manager configuration:

```nix
extra-substituters = [ "https://yazi.cachix.org" ];
extra-trusted-public-keys = [ "yazi.cachix.org-1:Dcdz63NZKfvUCbDGngQDAZq6kOroIrFoyO064uvLh8k=" ];
```

Note that the cache will only be applied _after_ you rebuild your Nix config. If you want to ensure that the cache gets applied right away, add the options above to your flake's `nixConfig` attribute.

If you're having any problems, refer to this [entry](https://docs.cachix.org/faq#why-is-nix-not-picking-up-on-any-of-the-pre-built-artifacts) from Cachix's FAQ.

## Homebrew {#homebrew}

First, make sure that Homebrew is fully up-to-date with `brew update`.

Then you can install Yazi (and the optional dependencies):

```sh
brew install yazi ffmpeg sevenzip jq poppler fd ripgrep fzf zoxide resvg imagemagick font-symbols-only-nerd-font
```

If you prefer to use the most recent code, use the `--HEAD` flag when installing Yazi.

```sh
brew install yazi --HEAD
```

## MacPorts {#macports}

```bash
sudo port install yazi ffmpeg 7zip jq poppler fd ripgrep fzf zoxide ImageMagick
```

## NetBSD {#netbsd}

```sh
pkgin install yazi ffmpeg7 p7zip jq poppler fd ripgrep fzf zoxide ImageMagick
```

## Windows {#windows}

Yazi relies on `file(1)` to detect the mime-type of the file, and the easiest and most reliable way to get it on Windows is to install Git for Windows and use the `file.exe` that comes with it.

1. Install Git for Windows by running [the official installer](https://git-scm.com/download/win), or through your package manager of choice.
2. To allow Yazi to use `file(1)`, add `<Git_Installed_Directory>\usr\bin\file.exe` to your `YAZI_FILE_ONE` environment variable, which differs depending on how you installed Git:
   - If you installed Git with the installer, it would be `C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\file.exe`.
   - If you installed Git with Scoop, it would be `C:\Users\<Username>\scoop\apps\git\current\usr\bin\file.exe`.
3. Restart your terminal.

This is **the ONLY way we recommend**. We do not recommend install `file` via Scoop or Chocolatey, since they cannot handle Unicode filenames (such as `oliver-sjöström.jpg`) properly and lack some required parameters.

Most users already have Git installed, and Yazi is also hosted via Git, so this usually isn't an issue. But if you really don't have/want to install it, the [`mime-ext.yazi`](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/mime-ext.yazi) plugin can help, which use a extension database instead of relying on the `file(1)` binary.

### Install with Scoop

```sh
scoop install yazi
# Install the optional dependencies (recommended):
scoop install ffmpeg 7zip jq poppler fd ripgrep fzf zoxide resvg imagemagick
```

### Install with WinGet

```sh
winget install sxyazi.yazi
# Install the optional dependencies (recommended):
winget install Gyan.FFmpeg 7zip.7zip jqlang.jq sharkdp.fd BurntSushi.ripgrep.MSVC junegunn.fzf ajeetdsouza.zoxide ImageMagick.ImageMagick
```

Poppler and resvg are not yet on WinGet, install with Scoop or manually download from [poppler-windows](https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows) and [resvg](https://github.com/linebender/resvg/releases).

## Debian based Linux {#debian}

In Debian/Ubuntu, you currently need to [manually build Yazi](/docs/installation#source) or [download our official binary release](/docs/installation#binaries).

You can install the optional dependencies with:

```sh
apt install ffmpeg 7zip jq poppler-utils fd-find ripgrep fzf zoxide imagemagick
```

Note that these dependencies are quite old on some Debian/Ubuntu versions and may cause Yazi to malfunction. In that case, you will need to manually build them from the latest source.

If you know how to package Yazi for Debian/Ubuntu and would like to help us submit it, please [file an issue](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/issues/new/choose).

## Fedora/Centos Stream 9+/RHEL 9+ {#copr}

:::info
This uses an [unofficial COPR repository](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/lihaohong/yazi) maintained by [Peter Li](https://github.com/lihaohong6).
:::

```sh
dnf copr enable lihaohong/yazi
dnf install yazi
```

`dnf` will install recommended dependencies automatically. To install only Yazi:

```sh
dnf copr enable lihaohong/yazi
dnf install yazi --setopt=install_weak_deps=False
```

If `dnf` complains about "No such command: copr", run `dnf install dnf-plugins-core` and then rerun the commands above.

## Snapcraft

<a href="https://snapcraft.io/yazi">
	<img height="40" alt="Install Yazi from Snapcraft" src="https://snapcraft.io/en/dark/install.svg" />
</a>

You can install Yazi from the [Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/yazi) with:

```sh
sudo snap install yazi --classic
```

If you want to keep up with the bleeding edge, get the nightly version with:

```sh
sudo snap install yazi --classic --edge
```

## Flatpak

:::warning
The Flatpak edition comes with many limitations due to sandboxing - see its [README](https://github.com/flathub/io.github.sxyazi.yazi) for details.

Power users are recommended to transition to an alternative installation to avoid unexpected breakages.
:::

<a href="https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.sxyazi.yazi">
	<img height="40" alt="Install Yazi from Flathub" src="https://flathub.org/api/badge?locale=en" />
</a>

After [installation](https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.sxyazi.yazi), you can run Yazi in the terminal with:

```sh
flatpak run io.github.sxyazi.yazi
```

You may want to create a shell alias:

```sh
alias yazi="flatpak run io.github.sxyazi.yazi"
```

See the Flatpak edition's [README](https://github.com/flathub/io.github.sxyazi.yazi) for more information.

## AOSC OS {#aosc}

```sh
sudo oma install yazi ffmpeg p7zip jq poppler fd ripgrep fzf zoxide imagemagick
```

## x-cmd {#x-cmd}

```sh
x env use yazi ffmpeg 7zz jq fd rg fzf zoxide magick
```

## Official binaries {#binaries}

You can download the latest official binaries from GitHub Releases: https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/releases

On this page, we offer GNU/Musl builds to meet the needs of different users.

This page also includes a [nightly release](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/releases/tag/nightly), which is built from the latest code within the past 6 hours.

## crates.io {#crates}

Yazi is available as [`yazi-fm`](https://crates.io/crates/yazi-fm) and [`yazi-cli`](https://crates.io/crates/yazi-cli) on [crates.io](https://crates.io/).

To install them, setup the latest stable Rust toolchain via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/):

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup update
```

Now you can install Yazi via `cargo`:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="non-windows" label="non-Windows" default>

```sh
cargo install --locked yazi-fm yazi-cli
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

```sh
cargo install --locked --profile release-windows yazi-fm yazi-cli
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Or install the latest Git version:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="non-windows" label="non-Windows" default>

```sh
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi.git yazi-fm yazi-cli
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

```sh
cargo install --locked --profile release-windows --git https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi.git yazi-fm yazi-cli
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If it fails to build, please check if `make` and `gcc` is installed on your system.

## Build from source {#source}

Setup the latest stable Rust toolchain via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/):

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup update
```

Clone the repository and build Yazi:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="non-windows" label="non-Windows" default>

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi.git
cd yazi
cargo build --release --locked
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi.git
cd yazi
cargo build --profile release-windows --locked
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then, add `yazi` and `ya` to your `$PATH`:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="non-windows" label="non-Windows" default>

```sh
mv target/release/yazi target/release/ya /usr/local/bin/
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

```sh
move target\release-windows\yazi.exe "%ProgramFiles%\yazi.exe"
move target\release-windows\ya.exe "%ProgramFiles%\ya.exe"
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If it fails to build, please check if `make` and `gcc` is installed on your system.

## Build from source in debug mode {#debug}

:::warning
Building Yazi in debug mode is for debugging purposes only, as it can speed up the build and provide more stack trace information.

It should not be used for daily purposes, as debug mode significantly reduces performance!
:::

Setup the latest stable Rust toolchain via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/):

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup update
```

Clone the repository and build Yazi:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi.git
cd yazi
cargo build --locked
```

Then, run `yazi` in debug mode:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="unix" label="Unix-like" default>

```sh
YAZI_LOG=debug RUST_BACKTRACE=1 ./target/debug/yazi
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="powershell" label="PowerShell">

```powershell
$env:YAZI_LOG = "debug"; $env:RUST_BACKTRACE = 1; .\target\debug\yazi.exe
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If it fails to build, please check if `make` and `gcc` is installed on your system.
