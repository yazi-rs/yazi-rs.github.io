## [filetype] {#filetype}

Set file list item display styles for specific file types, supporting matching by name and mime-type:

```toml
[filetype]
rules = [
	# Images
	{ mime = "image/*", fg = "yellow" },

	# Videos
	{ mime = "video/*", fg = "magenta" },
	{ mime = "audio/*", fg = "magenta" },

	# Empty files
	{ mime = "inode/empty", fg = "cyan" },

	# Orphan symbolic links
	{ name = "*", is = "orphan", fg = "red" },

	# ...

	# Fallback
	# { name = "*", fg = "white" },
	{ name = "*/", fg = "blue" }
]
```

Each rule supports complete [Style properties](#types.style). There are two special rule:

- `name = "*"` matches all files.
- `name = "*/"` matches all directories.

You can restrict the specific type of files through `is`, noting that it must be used with either `name` or `mime`. It accepts the following values:

- `block`: Block device
- `char`: Char device
- `exec`: Executable
- `fifo`: FIFO
- `link`: Symbolic link
- `orphan`: Orphan symbolic link
- `sock`: Socket
- `sticky`: File with sticky bit set

## [icon] {#icon}

Yazi has builtin support for [nvim-web-devicons](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons), a rich set of icons ready to use.
If you want to add your own rules to this set, you can use `prepend_*` and `append_*` to prepend or append rules to the default ones (see [Configuration Mixing](/docs/configuration/overview#mixing) for details):

```toml
[icon]
prepend_dirs = [
	{ name = "desktop", text = "", fg = "#563d7c" },
	# ...
]
append_exts = [
	{ name = "mp3", text = "", fg = "#00afff" },
	# ...
]
# ...
```

If you want to completely override the default rules, you can do so with:

```toml
[icon]
dirs = [
	{ name = "desktop", text = "", fg = "#563d7c" },
	# ...
]
exts = [
	{ name = "mp3", text = "", fg = "#00afff" },
	# ...
]
# ...
```

Each icon rule contains the following properties:

- `name` (globs, dirs, files, exts), or `if` (conds): the rule itself, which is a string
- `text`: icon text, which is a string
- `fg`: icon color, which is a [Color](/docs/configuration/theme#types.color)

Icons are matched according to the following priority:

1. globs: glob expressions, e.g., `{ name = "**/Downloads/*.zip", ... }`
2. dirs: directory names, e.g., `{ name = "Desktop", ... }`
3. files: file names, e.g., `{ name = ".bashrc", ... }`
4. exts: extensions, e.g., `{ name = "mp3", ... }`
5. conds: conditions, e.g., `{ if = "!dir", ... }`

`dirs`, `files`, and `exts` are compiled into a HashMap at startup, offering O(1) time complexity for very fast lookups, which should meet most needs.

For more complex and precise rules, such as matching a specific file in a specific directory, use `globs` - these are always executed first to check if any rules in the glob set are met.
However, they are much slower than `dirs`, `files`, and `exts`, so it's not recommended to use them excessively.

If none of the above rules match, it will fall back to `conds` to check if any specific conditions are met. `conds` are mostly used for rules related to file metadata, which includes the following conditional factors:

- `dir`: The file is a directory
- `hidden`: The file is hidden
- `link`: The file is a symbolic link
- `orphan`: The file is an orphan (broken symbolic link)
- `dummy`: The file is dummy (failed to load complete metadata, possibly the filesystem doesn't support it, such as FUSE)
- `block`: The file is a block device
- `char`: The file is a char device
- `fifo`: The file is a FIFO
- `sock`: The file is a socket
- `exec`: The file is executable
- `sticky`: The file has the sticky bit set

These conditions support basic `|` (or), `&` (and), `!` (not), and `()` for priority, so you can combine them as needed, for example:

```toml
[icon]
prepend_conds = [
	{ if = "hidden & dir",  text = "👻" },  # Hidden directories
	{ if = "dir",           text = "📁" },  # Directories
	{ if = "!(dir | link)", text = "📄" },  # Normal files (not directories or symlinks)
]
```
