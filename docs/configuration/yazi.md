:::

## [manager] {#manager}

### `ratio` {#manager.ratio}

Manager layout by ratio, 3-element array.

- `[1, 4, 3]`: 1/8 width for parent, 4/8 width for current, 3/8 width for preview

### `sort_by` {#manager.sort_by}

File sorting method.

- `"none"`: Don't sort.
- `"modified"`: Sort by last modified time.
- `"created"`: Sort by creation time.
- `"extension"`: Sort by file extension.
- `"alphabetical"`: Sort alphabetically, e.g. `1.md` < `10.md` < `2.md`
- `"natural"`: Sort naturally, e.g. `1.md` < `2.md` < `10.md`
- `"size"`: Sort by file size.
- `"random"`: Sort randomly.

### `sort_sensitive` {#manager.sort_sensitive}

Sort case-sensitively.

- `true`: Case-sensitive
- `false`: Case-insensitive

### `sort_reverse` {#manager.sort_reverse}

Display files in reverse order.

- `true`: Reverse order
- `false`: Normal order

### `sort_dir_first` {#manager.sort_dir_first}

Display directories first.

- `true`: Directories first
- `false`: Respects `sort_by` and `sort_reverse` only

### `sort_translit` {#manager.sort_translit}

Transliterate filenames for sorting (i.e. replaces `Â` as `A`, `Æ` as `AE`, etc.), only available if `sort_by = "natural"`.

This is useful for files that contain Hungarian characters.

- `true`: Enabled
- `false`: Disabled

### `linemode` {#manager.linemode}

Line mode: display information associated with the file on the right side of the file list row.

- `"none"`: No line mode.
- `"size"`: Display the size in bytes of the file. Note that currently directory sizes are only evaluated when [`sort_by = "size"`](/docs/configuration/yazi#manager.sort_by), and this might change in the future.
- `"ctime"`: Display the creation time of the file.
- `"mtime"`: Display the last modified time of the file.
- `"permissions"`: Display the permissions of the file, only available on Unix-like systems.
- `"owner"`: Display the owner of the file, only available on Unix-like systems.

You can also specify any 1 to 20 characters, and extend it within a UI plugin, which means you can implement your own linemode through the plugin system like this:

```toml
# ~/.config/yazi/yazi.toml
[manager]
linemode = "size_and_mtime"
```

```lua
-- ~/.config/yazi/init.lua
function Linemode:size_and_mtime()
	local year = os.date("%Y")
	local time = (self._file.cha.modified or 0) // 1

	if time > 0 and os.date("%Y", time) == year then
		time = os.date("%b %d %H:%M", time)
	else
		time = time and os.date("%b %d  %Y", time) or ""
	end

	local size = self._file:size()
	return ui.Line(string.format(" %s %s ", size and ya.readable_size(size) or "-", time))
end
```

### `show_hidden` {#manager.show_hidden}

Show hidden files.

- `true`: Show
- `false`: Do not show

### `show_symlink` {#manager.show_symlink}

Show the path of the symlink file point to, after the filename.

- `true`: Show
- `false`: Do not show

### `scrolloff` {#manager.scrolloff}

The number of files to keep above and below the cursor when moving through the file list.

If the value is larger than half the screen height (e.g. `200`), the cursor will be centered.

### `mouse_events` {#manager.mouse_events}

Array of strings, the types of mouse events can be received by the plugin system, available values:

- `"click"`: Mouse click
- `"scroll"`: Mouse vertical scroll
- `"touch"`: Mouse horizontal scroll
- `"move"`: Mouse move
- `"drag"`: Mouse drag (Some terminals do not support this)

### `title_format` {#manager.title_format}

The terminal title format, which is a string with the following placeholders available:

- `{cwd}` - current working directory

If you don't want Yazi to automatically update the title, set it to an empty string (`""`).

## [preview] {#preview}

### `tab_size` {#preview.tab_size}

Tab width.

### `max_width` {#preview.max_width}

Maximum preview width for images. Do a `yazi --clear-cache` to take effect after changing this.

This value is also used for preloading images; the larger it is, the larger the image cache generated, which consumes more CPU.

### `max_height` {#preview.max_height}

Maximum preview height for images. Do a `yazi --clear-cache` to take effect after changing this.

This value is also used for preloading images; the larger it is, the larger the image cache generated, which consumes more CPU.

### `cache_dir` {#preview.cache_dir}

The system cache directory is used by default, and the cached files will go away on a reboot automatically.

If you want to make it more persistent, you can specify the cache directory manually as an absolute path.

### `image_filter` {#preview.image_filter}

The filter used on image downscaling, available values:

- `"nearest"` - Nearest Neighbor
- `"triangle"` - Linear Triangle
- `"catmull-rom"` - Catmull-Rom
- `"lanczos3"` - Lanczos with window 3

They are arranged in order from fast to slow, and from poor to good quality - Lanczos3 provides the highest quality but is also the slowest.

See the example and benchmark here: https://docs.rs/image/0.24.8/image/imageops/enum.FilterType.html#examples

### `image_quality` {#preview.image_quality}

Quality on pre-caching images, range 50-90.

The larger value, the better image quality, but slower with more CPU consumption, and generates larger cache files that occupy more storage space.

### `sixel_fraction` {#preview.sixel_fraction}

Sixel is a very old image format that only supports 256 colors. For better image preview, Yazi trains a neural network for each image to find the most representative colors.

This value determines the number of samples used during the training, range 10-20. A smaller value produces better results but is also slower.

### `ueberzug_scale` / `ueberzug_offset` {#preview.ueberzug_scale}

- ueberzug_scale (Float): Ueberzug image scaling ratio, `scale>1` for enlargement, `scale<1` for reduction. For example, `0.5` indicates a reduction to half.
- ueberzug_offset (`[x, y, width, height]`): Ueberzug image offset, in cell units. For example, `[0.5, 0.5, -0.5, -0.5]` indicates that the image is offset by half a cell in both directions, and the width and height are reduced by half a cell.

This is useful for solving [a bug of Überzug++ image size calculation](https://github.com/jstkdng/ueberzugpp/issues/122).

If your monitor has a `2.0` scale factor, and is running on Wayland under Hyprland, you may need to set `ueberzug_scale: 0.5`, and adjust the value of `ueberzug_offset` according to your case, to offset this issue.

## [opener] {#opener}

Configure available openers that can be used in [`[open]`](#open), for example:

```toml
[opener]
edit = [
	{ run = 'nvim "$@"', block = true, for = "unix" },
	{ run = "nvim %*",   block = true, for = "windows" },
]
play = [
	{ run = 'mpv "$@"', orphan = true, for = "unix" },
	{ run = '"C:\Program Files\mpv.exe" %*', orphan = true, for = "windows" }
]
open = [
	{ run = 'xdg-open "$@"', desc = "Open" },
]
# ...
```

Available options are as follows:

- `run`: The command to open the selected files, with the following variables available:
  - `$n` (Unix) / `%n` (Windows): The N-th selected file, starting from `1`. e.g. `$2` represents the second selected file.
  - `$@` (Unix) / `%*` (Windows): All selected files, i.e. `$1`, `$2`, ..., `$n`.
  - `$0` (Unix) / `%0` (Windows): The hovered file.
- `block`: Open in a blocking manner. After setting this, Yazi will hide into a secondary screen and display the program on the main screen until it exits. During this time, it can receive I/O signals, which is useful for interactive programs.
- `orphan`: Keep the process running even if Yazi has exited, once specified, the process will be detached from the task scheduling system.
- `desc`: Description of the opener, display in interactive components, such as "Open with" and help menu.
- `for`: The opener is only available on this system; if not specified, it's available on all systems. Available values:
  - `unix`: Linux and macOS
  - `windows`: Windows
  - `linux`: Linux
  - `macos`: macOS

The commands specified by `run` follow platform-specific differences. For example, Unix shell requires wrapping `$` with quotes, while `%` in Windows batch scripts doesn't.

Refer to the documentation of `sh` and `cmd.exe` for details.

## [open] {#open}

Set rules for opening specific files. You can prepend or append rules to the default through `prepend_rules` and `append_rules` (See [Configuration mixing](/docs/configuration/overview#mixing) for details):

```toml
[open]
prepend_rules = [
	{ name = "*.json", use = "edit" },

	# Multiple openers for a single rule
	{ name = "*.html", use = [ "open", "edit" ] },
]
append_rules = [
	{ name = "*", use = "my-fallback" },
]
```

If your `append_rules` contains wildcard rules, they will always take precedence over the default wildcard rules as the fallback.

Or, use `rules` to rewrite the entire default rules:

```toml
[open]
rules = [
	{ mime = "text/*", use = "edit" },
	{ mime = "video/*", use = "play" },

	# { mime = "application/json", use = "edit" },
	{ name = "*.json", use = "edit" },

	# Multiple openers for a single rule
	{ name = "*.html", use = [ "open", "edit" ] },
]
```

Available rule options are as follows:

- `name`: Glob expression for matching the file name. Case insensitive by default, add `\s` to the beginning to make it sensitive.
- `mime`: Glob expression for matching the mime-type. Case insensitive by default, add `\s` to the beginning to make it sensitive.
- `use`: Opener name corresponding to the names in the [`[opener]` section](#opener).

With that:

- If you're using the default mime-type preloader, it retrieves the mime-type of a file through `file -bL --mime-type /path/to/file` command.
- If `use` is an array containing multiple openers, all commands in these openers will be merged. [`open`](/docs/configuration/keymap#manager.open) will run the first of these commands; [`open --interactive`](/docs/configuration/keymap#manager.open) will list all of these commands in the "open with" menu.

## [tasks] {#tasks}

### `micro_workers` {#tasks.micro_workers}

Maximum number of concurrent micro-tasks.

### `macro_workers` {#tasks.macro_workers}

Maximum number of concurrent macro-tasks.

### `bizarre_retry` {#tasks.bizarre_retry}

Maximum number of retries when a bizarre failure occurs.

### `suppress_preload` {#tasks.suppress_preload}

Exclude the preload tasks created by the system from the task list, do not report their progress, and do not consider them on app exit confirming.

### `image_alloc` {#tasks.image_alloc}

Maximum memory allocation limit in bytes for decoding a single image, `0` for unlimited.

### `image_bound` {#tasks.image_bound}

An array of `[width, height]`, maximum image size (in pixels) for decoding a single image, and `0` for unlimited.

## [plugin] {#plugin}

### previewers {#plugin.previewers}

You can prepend or append new preview rules to the default `previewers` under `[plugin]` by `prepend_previewers` and `append_previewers`, see [Configuration mixing](/docs/configuration/overview#mixing) for details.
Here are the available options for a single rule:

- `name` (String): Glob expression for matching the file name. Case insensitive by default, add `\s` to the beginning to make it sensitive.
- `mime` (String): Glob expression for matching the mime-type. Case insensitive by default, add `\s` to the beginning to make it sensitive.
- `run` (String): The name of the Lua plugin to be ran.
- `sync` (Boolean): Whether to run in the sync context, default is `false`.

```toml
[plugin]
prepend_previewers = [
	# HEIC previewer
	{ mime = "image/heic", run = "heic" },
]

append_previewers = [
	# My fallback previewer
	{ name = "*" , run = "binary" },
]
```

If your `append_previewers` contains wildcard `name` rules (`"*"` or `"*/"`), they will always take precedence over the default wildcard rules as the fallback.

Yazi comes with the these previewer plugins:

- folder: bridge between the Yazi file system and the preview
- code: bridge between built-in code highlighting and the preview, providing async concurrent rendering
- json: bridge between `jq` and the preview, providing async concurrent rendering
- noop: no operation
- image: presentation layer of built-in image preview, offering mixed preview capabilities
- video: bridge between `ffmpegthumbnailer` and the preview, offering mixed preview capabilities
- pdf: bridge between `pdftoppm` and the preview, offering mixed preview capabilities
- archive: bridge between 7-Zip and the preview, offering mixed preview and concurrent rendering capabilities

If you want to create your own previewer, see [Previewer API](/docs/plugins/overview#previewer).

### preloaders {#plugin.preloaders}

You can prepend or append new preview rules to the default `preloaders` under `[plugin]` by `prepend_preloaders` and `append_preloaders`, see [Configuration mixing](/docs/configuration/overview#mixing) for details.
Here are the available options for a single rule:

- `name` (String): Glob expression for matching the file name. Case insensitive by default, add `\s` to the beginning to make it sensitive.
- `mime` (String): Glob expression for matching the mime-type. Case insensitive by default, add `\s` to the beginning to make it sensitive.
- `cond` (String): Conditional expression – Only rules that meet this condition and satisfy either the `name` or `mime` will be applied. For example, `A & B` means A and B, and `A | !B` means A or not B. Here are the available factors:
  - `mime`: This file has a mime-type.
- `run` (String): The name of the Lua plugin to be ran.
- `multi` (Boolean): Whether to preload multiple files at once.
- `prio` (String): Preload priority, `low`, `normal` or `high`. The default is `normal` if not specified.

```toml
[plugin]
prepend_preloaders = [
	# HEIC preloader
	{ mime = "image/heic", run = "heic" },
]
```

Yazi comes with the these preloader plugins:

- mime: preloads mime-type of files in chunks
- noop: no operation
- image: preloads and caches images
- video: preloads and caches videos
- pdf: preloads and caches PDFs.

If you want to create your own preloader, see [Preloader API](/docs/plugins/overview#preloader).

## [input] {#input}

You can customize the title and position of each input. As for position, it consists of two parts: [Origin](#input.origin) and [Offset](#input.offset).

The origin is the top-left corner of the input, and the offset is the increment from this origin. Together, they determine the area of the input on the screen.

### Origin {#input.origin}

For the origin, the following values are available:

- top-left
- top-center
- top-right
- bottom-left
- bottom-center
- bottom-right
- center
- hovered (the cursor position of hovered file)

### Offset {#input.offset}

As for the offset, it's a 4-element tuple: `(x, y, width, height)`.

### Placeholder {#input.placeholder}

Some inputs have special placeholders that will be replaced with actual content on display:

- trash_title: String

  - `{n}`: Number of files to be trashed
  - `{s}`: `"s"` if `n > 1`, otherwise `""`

- delete_title: String

  - `{n}`: Number of files to be deleted
  - `{s}`: `"s"` if `n > 1`, otherwise `""`

- find_title: [String, String]

  It's a tuple of 2-element: first for "Find next", second for "Find previous".

- search_title: String

  - `{n}`: Name of the current search engine

  - `{n}`: Number of tasks are running
  - `{s}`: `"s"` if `n > 1`, otherwise `""`

## [select] {#select}

As same as the [`[input]`](#input) section.

## [which] {#which}

### `sort_by` {#which.sort_by}

Candidate sorting method.

- `"none"`: Don't sort.
- `"key"`: Sort by key.
- `"desc`: Sort by description.

### `sort_sensitive` {#which.sort_sensitive}

Sort case-sensitively.

- `true`: Case-sensitive
- `false`: Case-insensitive
