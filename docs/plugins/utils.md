# Utils

## ya

### `hide()` {#ya.hide}

Hide Yazi to the secondary screen by returning to the terminal, completely controlled by the requested plugin.

```lua
local permit = ya.hide()
```

This method returns a `permit` for this resource. When it's necessary to restore the TUI display, call its `drop()` method:

```lua
permit:drop()
```

Note that since there's always only one available terminal control resource, `ya.hide()` cannot be called again before the previous `permit` is dropped, otherwise an error will be thrown, effectively avoiding deadlocks.

This function is only available in the async context.

### `file_cache(opts)` {#ya.file_cache}

Calculate the cached [Url](/docs/plugins/types#shared.url) corresponding to the given file:

- `opts`: Required, the options of the cache, which is a table:

  - `file`: The [File](/docs/plugins/types#shared.file) to be cached.
  - `skip`: The number of units to skip. It's units largely depend on your previewer, such as lines for code, and percentages for videos.

If the file is not allowed to be cached, such as it's ignored in the user config, or the file itself is a cache, returns `nil`.

### `render()` {#ya.render}

Re-render the UI, can only be used in the sync context, for example:

```lua
local update_state = ya.sync(function(self, new_state)
	self.state = new_state
	ya.render()
end)
```

### `manager_emit(cmd, args)` {#ya.manager_emit}

Send a command to the [`[manager]`](/docs/configuration/keymap#manager) without waiting for the executor to execute:

- `cmd`: Required, the command name, which is a string.
- `args`: Required, the arguments of the command, which is a table with a number or string key and [sendable values](/docs/plugins/overview#sendable).

```lua
ya.manager_emit("my-cmd", { "hello", 123, foo = true, bar_baz = "world" })

-- Equivalent to:
-- my-cmd "hello" "123" --foo --bar-baz="world"
```

### `image_show(url, rect)` {#ya.image_show}

- `url`: Required, the [Url](/docs/plugins/types#shared.url) of the image.
- `rect`: Required, the [Rect](/docs/plugins/layout#rect) of the area.

This function is only available in the async context.

### `image_precache(src, dist)` {#ya.image_precache}

Pre-cache the image to a specified url based on user-configured [`max_width` and `max_height`](/docs/configuration/yazi#preview):

- `src`: Required, the source [Url](/docs/plugins/types#shared.url) of the image.
- `dist`: Required, the destination [Url](/docs/plugins/types#shared.url) of the image.

This function is only available in the async context.

### `which(opts)` {#ya.which}

Prompt users with a set of available keys:

- `opts`: Required, the options of the prompt, which is a table:
  - `cands`: Required, the key candidates, which is a table of tables that contains the following fields:
    - `on`: Required, the key to be prompted, which is a string or a table of strings if multiple keys.
    - `desc`: Optional, the description of the key, which is a string.
  - `silent`: Optional, whether to show the UI of key indicator, which is a boolean.

```lua
local cand = ya.which {
	cands = {
		{ on = "a" },
		{ on = "b", desc = "optional description" },
		{ on = "<C-c>", desc = "key combination" },
		{ on = { "d", "e" }, desc = "multiple keys" },
	},
	-- silent = true, -- If you don't want to show the UI of key indicator
}
```

When the user clicks a valid candidate, `ya.which` returns the 1-based index of that `cand`;
otherwise, it returns nil, indicating that the user has canceled the key operation.

This function is only available in the async context.

### `input(opts)` {#ya.input}

Request user input:

- `opts`: Required, the options of the input, which is a table:
  - `title`: Required, the title of the input, which is a string.
  - `value`: Optional, the default value of the input, which is a string.

```lua
local value, event = ya.input {
	title = "Archive name:",
	position = { "top-center", y = 3, w = 40 },
}
```

Returns `(value, event)`:

- `value`: The user input value carried by this event, which is a string if the `event` is non-zero; otherwise, `nil`.
- `event`: The event type, which is an integer:
  - 0: Unknown error.
  - 1: The user has confirmed the input.
  - 2: The user has canceled the input.
  - 3: The user has changed the input (only if `realtime` is true).

When `realtime = true` specified, `ya.input()` returns a receiver, which has a `recv()` method that can be called multiple times to receive events.

```lua
local input = ya.input {
	title = "Input in realtime:",
	position = { "center", w = 50 },
	realtime = true,
}

while true do
	local value, event = input:recv()
	if not value then
		break
	end

	ya.err(value)
end

Only available on Unix-like systems. Returns the hostname of the current machine, which is a string if successful; otherwise, `nil`.

## ps {#ps}

Yazi's DDS (Data Distribution Service) uses a Lua-based publish-subscribe model as its carrier. That is, you can achieve cross-instance communication and state persistence through the `ps` API. See [DDS](/docs/dds) for details.

The following functions can only be used within a sync context.

### `pub(kind, value)` {#ps.pub}

```lua
ps.pub("greeting", "Hello, World!")
```

Publish a message to the current instance, and all plugins subscribed through `sub()` for this `kind` will receive it, achieving internal communication within the instance:

- `kind`: Required, the kind of the message, which is a string of alphanumeric with dashes, and cannot be [built-in kinds](/docs/dds#builtin).
- `value`: Required, the value of the message, which is a [sendable value](/docs/plugins/overview#sendable).

Since the `kind` is used globally, to add the plugin name as the prefix is a best practice. For example, the combination of the plugin `my-plugin` and the kind `event1` would be `my-plugin-event1`.

### `pub_to(receiver, kind, value)` {#ps.pub_to}

```lua
ps.pub_to(1711957283332834, "greeting", "Hello, World!")
```

Publish a message to a specific instance with `receiver` as the ID:

- If the receiver is the current instance (local), and is subscribed to this `kind` through `sub()`, it will receive this message.
- If the receiver is not the current instance (remote), and is subscribed to this `kind` through `sub_remote()`, it will receive this message.

With:

- `receiver`: Required, ID of the remote instance, which is an integer; if it's `0` then broadcasting to all remote instances.
- `kind`: The same as `pub()`.
- `value`: The same as `pub()`.

### `sub(kind, callback)` {#ps.sub}

```lua
ps.sub("cd", function(body)
	ya.err("New cwd", cx.active.current.cwd)
end)
```

Subscribe to local messages of `kind` and call the `callback` handler for it:

- `kind`: Required, the kind of the message, which is a string.
- `callback`: Required, the callback function, with a single parameter `body` containing the content of the message.

It runs in a sync context, so you can access app data via `cx` for the content of interest.

Note: No time-consuming operations should be done in the callback, and the same `kind` from the same plugin can only be subscribed once, re-subscribing (`sub()`) before unsubscribing (`unsub()`) will throw an error.

### `sub_remote(kind, callback)` {#ps.sub_remote}

Similar to `sub()`, but it subscribes to remote messages of this `kind` instead of local.

### `unsub(kind)` {#ps.unsub}

```lua
ps.unsub("my-message")
```

Unsubscribe from local messages of this `kind`:

- `kind`: Required, the kind of the message, which is a string.

### `unsub_remote(kind)` {#ps.unsub_remote}

```lua
ps.unsub_remote("my-message")
```

Unsubscribe from remote messages of this `kind`:

- `kind`: Required, the kind of the message, which is a string.

## fs

The following functions can only be used within an async context.

### `cwd()` {#fs.cwd}

```lua
local url, err = fs.cwd()
```

This function was added to compensate for the lack of a [`getcwd`][getcwd] in Lua; it is used to retrieve the directory of the last [`chdir`][chdir] call.

Returns `(url, err)`:

- `url`: The [Url](/docs/plugins/types#shared.url) of the current working directory if successful; otherwise, `nil`.
- `err`: The error if the operation is failed, which is an [Error](/docs/plugins/types#shared.error).

You probably will never need it, and more likely, you'll need [`cx.active.current.cwd`][tab-folder], which is the current directory where the user is working.

Specifically, when the user changes the directory, `cx.active.current.cwd` gets updated immediately, while synchronizing this update with the filesystem via `chdir` involves I/O operations, such as checking if the directory is valid.

So, there may be some delay, which is particularly noticeable on slow devices. For example, when an HDD wakes up from sleep, it typically takes 3~4 seconds.

It is useful if you just need a valid directory as the CWD of a process to start some work that doesn't depend on the CWD.

[getcwd]: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getcwd.3.html
[chdir]: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/chdir.2.html
[tab-folder]: /docs/plugins/types#app-data.tab-folder

- `err`: The error if the operation is failed, which is an [Error](/docs/plugins/types#shared.error).

### `write(url, data)` {#fs.write}

```lua
local ok, err = fs.write(url, "hello world")
```

Write data to the specified file:

- `url`: Required, the [Url](/docs/plugins/types#shared.url) of the file.
- `data`: Required, the data to be written, which is a string.

Returns `(ok, err)`:

- `ok`: Whether the operation is successful, which is a boolean.
- `err`: The error if the operation is failed, which is an [Error](/docs/plugins/types#shared.error).

### `create(type, url)` {#fs.create}

```lua
local ok, err = fs.create("dir_all", Url("/tmp/test/nest/nested"))
```

Create the specified file(s) in the filesystem.

- `type`: Required, the type of creation, which can be:
  - `"dir"`: Creates a new, empty directory.
  - `"dir_all"`: Recursively create a directory and all of its parents if they are missing.
- `url`: Required, the [Url](/docs/plugins/types#shared.url) of the target.

Returns `(ok, err)`:

- `ok`: Whether the operation is successful, which is a boolean.
- `err`: The error if the operation is failed, which is an [Error](/docs/plugins/types#shared.error).

### `remove(type, url)` {#fs.remove}

```

Remove the specified file(s) from the filesystem:

- `type`: Required, the type of removal, which can be:
  - `"file"`: Removes a file from the filesystem.
  - `"dir"`: Removes an existing, empty directory.
  - `"dir_all"`: Removes a directory at this url, after removing all its contents. Use carefully!
  - `"dir_clean"`: Remove all empty directories under it, and if the directory itself is empty afterward, remove it as well.
- `url`: Required, the [Url](/docs/plugins/types#shared.url) of the target.

Returns `(ok, err)`:

- `ok`: Whether the operation is successful, which is a boolean.
- `err`: The error if the operation is failed, which is an [Error](/docs/plugins/types#shared.error).

### `read_dir(url, options)` {#fs.read_dir}

```lua
local files, err = fs.read_dir("url", { limit = 10 })
```

Reads the contents of a directory:

- `url`: Required, the [Url](/docs/plugins/types#shared.url) of the directory.
- `options`: Optional, a table with the following options:

- `err`: The error if the operation is failed, which is an [Error](/docs/plugins/types#shared.error).

### `unique_name(url)`

```lua
local url, err = fs.unique_name(Url("/tmp/test.txt"))
```

Get a unique name from the given [Url](/docs/plugins/types#shared.url) to ensure it's unique in the filesystem:

- `url`: Required, the [Url](/docs/plugins/types#shared.url) of the path to get a unique name.

Returns `(url, err)`:

- `url`: The unique [Url](/docs/plugins/types#shared.url) of the given path if successful; otherwise, `nil`.
- `err`: The error if the operation is failed, which is an [Error](/docs/plugins/types#shared.error).

If the file already exists, the function will append `_n` to the filename, where `n` is a number, and keep incrementing it until it finds the first available name.

## Command

You can invoke external programs through:

```lua
local child, err = Command("ls")
	:args({ "-a", "-l" })
	:stdout(Command.PIPED)
	:spawn()
```

Compared to Lua's `os.execute`, it provides many comprehensive and convenient methods, and the entire process is async.

It takes better advantage of the benefits of concurrent scheduling. However, it can only be used in async contexts, such as preloaders, previewers, and async functional plugins.

### `arg(arg)` {#Command.arg}

```

Set the stdin of the command:

- `cfg`: Required, the configuration of the stdin, accepts the following values:
  - `Command.PIPED`: Pipe the stdin.

```

Set the stdout of the command:

- `cfg`: Required, the configuration of the stdout, accepts the following values:
  - `Command.PIPED`: Pipe the stdout.

- `output`: The [Output](#output) of the command if successful; otherwise, `nil`.
- `err`: The error if the operation is failed, which is an [Error](/docs/plugins/types#shared.error).

### `status()` {#Command.status}

```lua
local status, err = Command("ls"):status()
```

Executes the command as a child process, waiting for it to finish and collecting its exit status. Returns `(status, err)`:

- `status`: The [Status](#status) of the child process if successful; otherwise, `nil`.
- `err`: The error if the operation is failed, which is an [Error](/docs/plugins/types#shared.error).

## Child

This object is created by [`Command:spawn()`](#Command.spawn) and represents a running child process.

You can access the runtime data of this process through its proprietary methods.

### `read(len)` {#Child.read}

```lua
local data, event = child:read(1024)
```

Let's say "available data source" refers to `stdout` or `stderr` that has been set with `Command.PIPED`, or them both.

`read()` reads data from the available data source alternately, and the `event` indicates the source of the data:

- The data comes from stdout if event is 0.
- The data comes from stderr if event is 1.
- There's no data to read from both stdout and stderr, if event is 2.

### `read_line()` {#Child.read_line}

```lua
local line, event = child:read_line()
```

Similar to [`read()`](#Child.read), but it reads data line by line.

### `read_line_with(opts)` {#Child.read_line_with}

```lua
local line, event = child:read_line_with { timeout = 500 }
```

Similar to [`read_line()`](#Child.read_line), but it accepts a table of options:

- `timeout`: Required, timeout in milliseconds, which is an integer

And includes the following additional events:

- Timeout if event is 3.

### `write_all(src)` {#Child.write_all}

```lua
local ok, err = child:write_all(src)
```

Writes all bytes from the string `src` to the stdin of the child process, returns `(ok, err)`:

- `ok`: Whether the operation is successful, which is a boolean.
- `err`: The error if the operation is failed, which is an [Error](/docs/plugins/types#shared.error).

Please ensure that the child's stdin is available when calling this method, specifically:

1. [`stdin(Command.PIPED)`](/docs/plugins/utils#Command.stdin) is set.
2. [`take_stdin()`](/docs/plugins/utils#Child.take_stdin) has never been called.

Otherwise, an error will be thrown.

### `flush()` {#Child.flush}

```lua
local ok, err = child:flush()
```

Flushes any buffered data to the stdin of the child process, returns `(ok, err)`:

- `ok`: Whether the operation is successful, which is a boolean.
- `err`: The error if the operation is failed, which is an [Error](/docs/plugins/types#shared.error).

Please ensure that the child's stdin is available when calling this method, specifically:

1. [`stdin(Command.PIPED)`](/docs/plugins/utils#Command.stdin) is set.
2. [`take_stdin()`](/docs/plugins/utils#Child.take_stdin) has never been called.

Otherwise, an error will be thrown.

### `wait()` {#Child.wait}

```lua
local status, err = child:wait()
```

Wait for the child process to finish, returns `(status, err)`:

- `status`: The [Status](#status) of the child process if successful; otherwise, `nil`.
- `err`: The error if the operation is failed, which is an [Error](/docs/plugins/types#shared.error).

### `wait_with_output()` {#Child.wait_with_output}

```lua
local output, err = child:wait_with_output()
```

Wait for the child process to finish and get the output, returns `(output, err)`:

- `output`: The [Output](#output) of the child process if successful; otherwise, `nil`.
- `err`: The error if the operation is failed, which is an [Error](/docs/plugins/types#shared.error).

### `start_kill()` {#Child.start_kill}

```lua
local ok, err = child:start_kill()
```

Send a SIGTERM signal to the child process, returns `(ok, err)`:

- `ok`: Whether the operation is successful, which is a boolean.
- `err`: The error if the operation is failed, which is an [Error](/docs/plugins/types#shared.error).

### `take_stdin()` {#Child.take_stdin}

```lua
local stdin = child:take_stdin()
```

Take and return the stdin stream of the child process, which can only be called once and is only applicable to processes with [`stdin(Command.PIPED)`](/docs/plugins/utils#Command.stdin) set; otherwise, it returns `nil`.

### `take_stdout()` {#Child.take_stdout}

```lua
local stderr = child:take_stdout()
```

Take and return the stdout stream of the child process, which can only be called once and is only applicable to processes with [`stdout(Command.PIPED)`](/docs/plugins/utils#Command.stdin) set; otherwise, it returns `nil`.

This is useful when redirecting stdout to another process's stdin:

```lua
local echo = Command("echo"):arg("Hello"):stdout(Command.PIPED):spawn()

local rev = Command("rev"):stdin(echo:take_stdout()):stdout(Command.PIPED):output()

ya.err(rev.stdout) -- "olleH\n"
```

### `take_stderr()` {#Child.take_stderr}

```lua
local stderr = child:take_stderr()
```

Take and return the stderr stream of the child process, which can only be called once and is only applicable to processes with [`stderr(Command.PIPED)`](/docs/plugins/utils#Command.stdin) set; otherwise, it returns `nil`.

See [`take_stdout()`](/docs/plugins/utils#Child.take_stdout) for an example.

## Output

Properties:

- `status`: The [Status](#status) of the child process.
- `stdout`: The stdout of the child process, which is a string.
- `stderr`: The stderr of the child process, which is a string.

## Status

This object represents the exit status of a child process, and it is created by [`wait()`](#Child.wait), or [`output()`](#Command.output).

Properties:

- `success`: whether the child process exited successfully, which is a boolean.
- `code`: the exit code of the child process, which is an integer if any.
